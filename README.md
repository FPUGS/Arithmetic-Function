solve this using any FP lang you want.  
Haskell, F#, Closure, Ocaml, Scala, Common Lisp, D, Erlang, etc.  
You can solve the same code kata in multiple languages by creating more braches.

## To submit your solution

- fork this repo (do not clone, even though you have push access)
- create a branch with `[your username]`/`[lang]` example: `theRemix/ocaml`
- work on your branch
- push to your own repo
- do a pull request, from `your origin/your_name_branch` to `FPUGS/your_name_branch` (it might not exist, so create it? or just use master)
- when @theRemix reviews it, he will accept the pull request  
  - or accept your own pull request if you don't want to be reviewed (since you have access to accept it to FPUGS)
- post on Hipchat with the link to your fork url
