# Arithmetic-Function

A solution to [FPUGS/Arithmetic-Function](https://github.com/FPUGS/Arithmetic-Function) in OCaml.

It has been a very long time since I've OCaml'd, so, there's probably a better way to do this...

# Run the Things!

1. [Install OCaml!](https://ocaml.org/)
2. Make!

  ```bash
  make
  ```
3. Run!

  ```bash
  ./arithmetic
  ```

Ohh, fancy!
